          <h2>Workshop for Natural Language Processing Open Source Software (NLP-OSS)</h2>

<h3>20 July 2018 @ ACL</h3>

<p>With great scientific breakthroughs come solid engineering and open communities. The Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has benefited greatly from the open culture in sharing knowledge, data, and software. The primary objective of this workshop is to further the sharing of insights on the engineering and community aspects of creating, developing, and maintaining NLP open source software (OSS) which we seldom talk about in scientific publications. Our secondary goal is to promote synergies between different open source projects and encourage cross-software collaborations and comparisons.</p>

<p>We refer to Natural Language Processing OSS as an umbrella term that not only covers traditional syntactic, semantic, phonetic, and pragmatic applications; we extend the definition to include task-specific applications (e.g., machine translation, information retrieval, question-answering systems), low-level string processing that contains valid linguistic information (e.g. Unicode creation for new languages, language-based character set definitions) and machine learning/artificial intelligence frameworks with functionalities focusing on text applications.</p>

<!-- There are many workshops focusing on open language resource/annotation creation and curation (e.g. BUCC, GWN, LAW, LOD, WAC). Moreover, we have the flagship LREC conference dedicated to linguistic resources. However, the engineering aspects of NLP OSS are overlooked and under-discussed within the community. There are open source conferences and venues (such as FOSDEM, OSCON, Open Source Summit) where discussions range from operating system kernels to air traffic control hardware but the representation of NLP-related presentations is limited. In the Machine Learning (ML) field, the Journal of Machine Learning Research - Machine Learning Open Source Software (JMLR-MLOSS) is a forum for discussions and dissemination of ML OSS topics. We envision that the Workshop for NLP-OSS becomes a similar avenue for NLP OSS discussions.

To our best knowledge, this is the first workshop proposal in the recent years that focuses more on the building aspect of NLP and less on scientific novelty or state-of-art development. A decade ago, there was the SETQA-NLP (Software Engineering, Testing, and Quality Assurance for Natural Language Processing) workshop that raised awareness of the need for good software engineering practices in NLP.
-->

<p>In the earlier days of NLP, linguistic software was often monolithic and the learning curve to install, use, and extend the tools was steep and frustrating. More often than not, NLP OSS developers/users interact in siloed communities within the ecologies of their respective projects. In addition to engineering aspects of NLP software, the open source movement has brought a community aspect that we often overlook in building impactful NLP technologies.</p>

<p>An example of precious OSS knowledge comes from SpaCy developer <a href="https://ines.io/blog/spacy-commercial-open-source-nlp">Montani (2017)</a>, who shared her thoughts and challenges of maintaining commercial NLP OSS, such as handling open issues on the issue tracker, model release and packaging strategy and monetizing NLP OSS for sustainability.</p>

<p><a href="https://rare-technologies.com/mummy-effect-bridging-gap-between-academia-industry/">Řehůřek (2017)</a> shared another example of insightful discussion on bridging the gap between academia and industry through creating open source and student incubation programs. Řehůřek discussed the need to look beyond the publish-or-perish culture to avoid the brittle “mummy effect” in SOTA research code/techniques.</p>

<p>We hope that the NLP-OSS workshop becomes the intellectual forum to collate various open source knowledge beyond the scientific contribution, announce new software/features, promote the open source culture and best practices that go beyond the conferences.</p>

	<strong><a href="slides/nothman.pdf">Open-Source Software's Responsibility to Science</a></strong><br>
	<a href="https://github.com/jnothman">Joel Nothman</a>, University of Sydney
</h3>

<p>Open-source software makes sophisticated technologies available to a wide audience. Arguably, most people applying language processing and machine learning techniques rely on popular open source tools targeted at these applications. Users may themselves be incapable of implementing the underlying algorithms. Users may or may not have extensive training to critically conduct experiments with these tools.</p>

<p>As maintainers of popular scientific software, we should be aware of our user base, and consider the ways in which our software design and documentation can lead or mislead users with respect to scientific best practices. In this talk, I will present some examples of these risks, primarily drawn from my experience developing Scikit-learn. For example: How can we help users avoid data leakage in cross-validation? How can we help users report precisely which algorithm or metric was used in an experiment?</p>

<p>Volunteer OSS maintainers have limited ability to see and manage these risks, and need the scientific community’s assistance to get things right in design, implementation and documentation.</p>

<p>Joel began contributing to the Scientific Python ecosystem of open-source software as a research student at the University of Sydney in 2008. He has since made substantial contributions to the NLTK, Scipy, Pandas and IPython packages among others, but presently puts most of his open-source energies into maintaining Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning toolkit. Joel works as a data science research engineer at the University of Sydney, who fund some of his open-source development efforts. He completed his PhD on event reference there in 2014, and has been teaching their Natural Language Processing unit since 2016.</p>

<h3>
	<strong>Stanford CoreNLP: 15 Years of Developing Academic Open Source Software</strong><br>
	<a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/">Christopher Manning</a>, Stanford University
</h3>

<p>My students and I at the Stanford NLP Group started releasing academic open source NLP software relatively early, in 2002. Over the years, the status and popularity of particular tools, and, since 2010, of the integrated Stanford CoreNLP offering has continually grown. It is not only used as a reliable tool — and easy mark to beat — in academic NLP, but it is widely used across government, non-profits, startups, and large companies. In this talk, I give my reflections on building academic open source software: what is required, what is important, and what is not so important; what we did right and what we did wrong; how a software project can be maintained long-term in such a context, how it adds to and detracts from doing academic research, narrowly defined; and how the world has changed and what the prospects are for the future.</p>

<h3>
	<strong>Reflections on Running spaCy: Commercial Open-source NLP</strong><br/>
	<a href="https://explosion.ai/">Matthew Honnibal and Ines Montani</a>, Explosion AI
</h3>

In this talk, I'll share some lessons we've learned from running spaCy, the fastest-growing library for Natural Language Processing in Python, and provide our perspective on how to make commercial open-source work for both users and developers. Every open-source project must strike a balance between the responsibilities and control of the maintainers, and the responsibilities and control of the users. Understanding and communicating the motivations for publishing software under an open-source license can put less pressure on maintainers, and help users select projects appropriate for their requirements.
